	abstract = {Recent multi-robot exploration algorithms usually rely on occupancy grids as their core world representation. However, those grids are not appropriate for environments that are very large or whose boundaries are not well delimited from the beginning of the exploration. In contrast, polygonal representations do not have such limitations. Previously, the authors have proposed a new exploration algorithm based on partitioning unknown space into as many regions as available robots by applying K-Means clustering to an occupancy grid representation, and have shown that this approach leads to higher robot dispersion than other approaches, which is potentially beneficial for quick coverage of wide areas. In this paper, the original K-Means clustering applied over grid cells, which is the most expensive stage of the aforementioned exploration algorithm, is substituted for a Voronoi-based partitioning algorithm applied to polygons. The computational cost of the exploration algorithm is thus significantly reduced for large maps. An empirical evaluation and comparison of both partitioning approaches is presented.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new coordination algorithm for efficiently exploring an unknown environment with a team of mobile robots. The proposed technique subsequently applies a well-known unsupervised clustering algorithm (K-Means) in order to fairly divide the remaining unknown space into as many disjoint regions as available robots. Each robot is primarily responsible for exploring its assigned region and can help other robots on its way through. Unknown space is dynamically repartitioned as new areas are discovered by the team, balancing thus the overall workload among team members and naturally leading to greater dispersion over the environment and thus faster broad coverage than with previous greedy-like approaches, which guide robots based on maximum profit strategies that simply trade off between distance to the closest frontiers and amount of unknown cells likely to be discovered from them.},

Over the past few years, several studies have evaluated the potential of spatial models for robot navigation and ubiquitous computing. In this paper we take a slightly different perspective, considering not only the underlying properties of those spatial models, but also to which degree the notion of context can be taken into account when delivering services in indoor environments. Some preliminary recommendations for the development of indoor spatial models are introduced from a context-aware perspective. A taxonomy of models is then presented and assessed with the aim of providing a flexible spatial data model for navigation purposes, and by taking into account the context dimensions.},

abstract = {In the field of mobile robotics, one important issue is to allow the robot to navigate in an a priori unknown and non specific large scale environment. Large dimensions raise strong limitations of geometric modeling, and topological or mixed metric-topological models are now studied to better fit the problem. In this paper, we present a new method for incrementally building a topological model of an indoor environment from sensor range data. The approach consists in merging each local perception of the topology with the current state of the global graph. This local topology is captured through the construction of a Vorono{\"{i}}-like graph that takes into account not only visible features but also visibility constrains (hidden regions, limited sensing ranges, ...). We give the outline of the method and show first encouraging results on real data.},

We employ a Gaussian mixture model for global mapping to model complex environment geometries while maintaining a small memory footprint which enables distributed operation with a low volume of communication. We then generate a local occupancy grid for use in planning from the Gaussian mixture model using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Then, a finite-horizon, information-based planner uses this local map and optimizes sequences of observations locally while accounting for the global distribution of information in the robot state space which we model using a library of informative views. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system is able to maintain efficiency and completeness in exploration while only requiring a low rate of communication.},

abstract = {Validating robotics projects is a hard task. It demands more than intellectual effort, but also specific hardware usage, turning the designed project expensive and because of that, unviable to be executed. This process can be improved by the use of 3D simulators, which have been developed directed to scenarios such as architecture, games and virtual reality experiences, and can also be applied to robotics. There are available many 3D simulator options in the market, paid or free. Considering the 3D simulator options, a robotics project designer may have questions on how to choose the best suitable one. From that, this paper intends to analyze these software focusing on robotics simulation, proposing to clarify some questions and guide the simulator choice. After a literature review made in two stages (a more general search regarding 3D simulators and then the final choice considering abstract and conclusion), it was possible to choose the three most used ones by the robotic community: V-Rep, Gazebo, and Unity. We made a more in-depth study about them in order to evaluate and describe important features related to robotics. Later, we also did experiments using each tool intending to analyze terms relative to usability. The experiment consisted of replicating the same standard 3D scene in the three software. Based on the literature review and the experiments, it became possible to punctuate some observations. In terms of usability, V-Rep and Unity presented a significant degree of freedom considering scene editing, besides both having a friendly interface, while Gazebo showed to be more limited and it has a poor user interface. In the three simulators it is possible to perform a connection with ROS, but with different complexities, being Gazebo and V-Rep the easiest ones. They both have more features and facilities when considering developing a robotics project, leaving Unity behind.},

However, those grids are not appropriate for environments that are very large or whose boundaries are not well delimited from the beginning of the exploration. In contrast, polygonal representations do not have such limitations. Previously, the authors have proposed a new exploration algorithm based on partitioning unknown space into as many regions as available robots by applying K-Means clustering to an occupancy grid representation, and have shown that this approach leads to higher robot dispersion than other approaches, which is potentially beneficial for quick coverage of wide areas. In this paper, the original K-Means clustering applied over grid cells, which is the most expensive stage of the aforementioned exploration algorithm, is substituted for a Voronoi-based partitioning algorithm applied to polygons. The computational cost of the exploration algorithm is thus significantly reduced for large maps. An empirical evaluation and comparison of both partitioning approaches is presented.},

To achieve this, it partitions the space into segments, for example, corresponding to individual rooms. Instead of only considering frontiers between unknown and explored areas as target locations, we send the robots to the individual segments with the task to explore the corresponding area. Our approach has been implemented and tested in simulation as well as in real world experiments.

abstract = {In mobile robotics, the exploration task consists of navigating through an unknown environment and building a representation of it. The mobile robot community has developed many approaches to solve this problem. These methods are mainly based on two key ideas. The first one is the selection of promising regions to explore and the second is the minimization of a cost function involving the distance traveled by the robots, the time it takes for them to finish the exploration, and others. An option to solve the exploration problem is the use of multiple robots to reduce the time needed for the task and to add fault tolerance to the system. We propose a new method to explore unknown areas, by using a scene partitioning scheme and assigning weights to the frontiers between explored and unknown areas. Energy consumption is always a concern during the exploration, for this reason our method is a distributed algorithm, which helps to reduce the number of communications between robots. By using this approach, we also effectively reduce the time needed to explore unknown regions and the distance traveled by each robot. We performed comparisons of our approach with state-of-the-art methods, obtaining a visible advantage over other works.},

In this work, we first propose a set of criteria to assess the quality of topological segmentation, especially for semi-structured environments in 2D. These criteria provide a general benchmark for different segmentation algorithms. Then we introduce an incremental approach to create topological segmentation for semi-structured environments. Our novel approach is based on spectral clustering of an incremental generalized Voronoi decomposition of discretized metric maps. It extracts sparse spatial information from the maps, and builds an environment model which aims at simplifying the navigation task for mobile robots. Experimental results in real environments show the robustness and the quality of the topological map created by the proposed method. Extended experiments for urban search and rescue missions are performed to show the global consistency of the proposed incremental segmentation method using six different trails, during which the test robot traveled 1.8 km in total.},

@article{Thrun1998,
abstract = {Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their environments. Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile robot in populated multi-room environments. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {We present and evaluate new ROS packages for coordinated multi-robot exploration, namely communication, global map construction, and exploration. The packages allow completely distributed control and do not rely on (but allow) central controllers. Their integration including application layer protocols allows out of the box installation and execution. The communication package enables reliable ad hoc communication allowing to exchange local maps between robots which are merged to a global map. Exploration uses the global map to spatially spread robots and decrease exploration time. The intention of the implementation is to offer basic functionality for coordinated multi-robot systems and to enable other research groups to experimentally work on multi-robot systems. The packages are tested in real-world experiments using Turtlebot and Pioneer robots. Further, we analyze their performance using simulations and verify their correct working. I.},

abstract = {In robotics, grid maps are often used for solving tasks like collision checking, path planning, and localization. Many approaches to these problems use Euclidean distance maps (DMs), generalized Voronoi diagrams (GVDs), or configuration space (c-space) maps. A key challenge for their application in dynamic environments is the efficient update after potential changes due to moving obstacles or when mapping a previously unknown area. To this end, this paper presents novel algorithms that perform incremental updates that only visit cells affected by changes. Furthermore, we propose incremental update algorithms for DMs and GVDs in the configuration space of non-circular robots. These approaches can be used to implement highly efficient collision checking and holonomic path planning for these platforms. Our c-space representations benefit from parallelization on multi-core CPUs and can also be integrated with other state-of-the-art path planners such as rapidly-exploring random trees. In various experiments using real-world data we show that our update strategies for DMs and GVDs require substantially less cell visits and computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our GVD algorithm deals better with non-convex structures, such as indoor areas. All our algorithms consider actual Euclidean distances rather than grid steps and are easy to implement. An open source implementation is available online. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A route graph as proposed in Werner et al. (2000) is a spatial representation of the environment that focuses on integrating qualitatively different routes an agent can use for navigation. In this paper we describe how a route graph based on the generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) of the environment can be used for mobile robot mapping and navigation tasks in an office-like indoor environment. We propose a hierarchical organization of the graph structure resulting in more abstract layers that represent the environment at coarser levels of granularity. For this purpose, we define relevance measures to weight the meet points in the GVD based on how significant they are for navigation and present an algorithm that utilizes these weights to generate the coarser route graph layers. Computation of the relevance values from either complete or incomplete information about the environment is considered. Besides robot navigation, the techniques developed can be employed for other tasks in which abstract route graph representations are advantageous, e.g. automatically generating route descriptions from floor plans. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

@article{Corah2019a,
abstract = {This work addresses the problem of efficient online exploration and mapping using multi-robot teams via a new distributed algorithm for multi-robot exploration, distributed sequential greedy assignment (DSGA), which is based on sequential greedy assignment (SGA). While SGA permits bounds on suboptimality, robots must execute planning steps sequentially. Rather than plan for each robot sequentially as in SGA, DSGA assigns plans to subsets of robots using a fixed number of sequential planning rounds. DSGA retains the same suboptimality bounds as SGA with the addition of a term that describes the additional suboptimality incurred when assigning multiple plans at once. We use this result to extend a single-robot planner based on Monte-Carlo tree search to the multi-robot domain and evaluate the resulting planner in simulated exploration of a confined and cluttered environment. The experimental results show that for teams of 4–32 robots suboptimality due to redundant sensor information introduced in the distributed planning rounds remains small in practice given only two or three distributed planning rounds while providing a 2–8 times speedup over SGA. We also incorporate aerial robots with inter-robot collision constraints and non-trivial dynamics and address subsequent impacts on safety and optimality. Real-time simulation and experimental results for teams of quadrotors demonstrate online planning for multi-robot exploration and indicate that collision constraints have limited impacts on exploration performance.},

abstract = {Performance benchmarking has become an important topic within robotics. It is indeed, a critical way to compare different solutions under different conditions. In this paper, we focus on performance benchmarking of multi-robot systems which explore and map unknown terrains. We present a collection of metrics to objectively compare different algorithms that can be applied to collaborative multi-robot exploration. We also identify parameters that impact robotic fleet performances. By varying the parameters, we can identify strengths and limits of an algorithm. This work is also a first concrete step to address the general problem of objectively comparing different multi-robot coordination algorithms. We illustrate these contributions with realistic simulations of the frontier-based exploration strategy. The simulations were implemented in ROS, which enables to uncouple the control software from the drivers of the robot body. We can therefore use the same code on both simulation and real robots.},

abstract = {The exploration of an unknown environment is a classical and essential challenge in mobile robotics. Typically, the overall exploration time is the most commonly used quality indicator. Choosing a stop exploration criterion represents a critical issue, and the simple rule of exploring until reaching a given coverage percentage is useful only on simulations, but futile in practice. In this work we propose a stop criterion based on the expected information gain of the exploring fleet; we show that every component of the fleet can autonomously check whether there are reachable cells from where new information can be gathered, and this fact can be used to take a decision. We measure the exploring area error introduced by the stop decision, concluding that the proposal is feasible, while improvable. Certainly, the stop decisions are taken autonomously, and we understand that a cooperative approach may further improve the proposal. The experiments that support this work are built using ROS over the MORSE physical simulator.},

However there are inherent drawbacks of spectral clustering algorithms. In this paper, we first discuss these drawbacks using several testing results; then we propose our approach based on information theory which uses Chow-Liu tree to segment the composed graph according to the weight differences.

abstract = {In a decentralized multi-robot exploration problem, the robots have to cooperate effectively to map a strange environment as soon as possible without a centralized controller. In the past few decades, a set of “human-designed” cooperation strategies have been proposed to address this problem, such as the well-known frontier-based approach. However, many real-world settings, especially the ones that are constantly changing, are too complex for humans to design efficient and decentralized strategies. This paper presents a novel approach, the Attention-based Communication neural network (CommAttn), to “learn” the cooperation strategies automatically in the decentralized multi-robot exploration problem. The communication neural network enables the robots to learn the cooperation strategies with explicit communication. Moreover, the attention mechanism we introduced additionally can precisely calculate whether the communication is necessary for each pair of agents by considering the relevance of each received message, which enables the robots to communicate only with the necessary partners. The empirical results on a simulated multi-robot disaster exploration scenario demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the traditional “human-designed” methods, as well as other competing “learning-based” methods in the exploration task.},
